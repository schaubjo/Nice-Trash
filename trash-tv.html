                of Caillou. I'm reluctant to even put it on here.</p>

            <p>I hate how people actually enjoy this show. It was good for like maybe 2 seasons, but a lot of the
                episodes are still trash. Also, I hate that wannabe TikToker, Noah Schnapp. This show would be better if
                they got rid of the entire thing and replaced it with Succession.</p>

            <p>This show has like 4ish very good episodes, but the rest is unbelievably mediocre. The actors and the
                dialogue are the only things that make it good. I think there wasn't so much yelling, then the audience
                wouldn't be so distracted, and they would realize that the plot is extremely mediocre. All they try and
                do is make a successful restaurant, which is the exact same plot of every other cooking/restaurant show.
                The main actor is very good, but they also are turning his character into a crybaby for no reason. Also,
                I hate Hulu.</p>

            <p>I used to think this show was the greatest show of all time. Then, I proceeded to watch more animated
                shows that left this show in the dust. There's just too many filler episodes, and the plot is extremely
                simple and mediocre if you just take a step back. There were a lot of missed opportunities of things to
                do with the show, and there are just so many other animated shows that are 10x better.</p>

            <p>I get that like 20% of the show is really good, but it does not make up for the fact that the rest of the
                show is useless filler that contributes nothing to the story. I hate how millions of dollars can go
                towards Star Wars episodes that do not affect the story in the slightest. This show had so much
                potential, and it is definitely lacking in some departments. There are definitely a few good episodes,
                but overall, the show is mediocre.</p>

            <p>This is a review for just the last season:
                <br></br>
                There should be some legal punishment for making a season this
                bad. Every single fan-written ending for this show was better than the actual ending we got. They
                essentially made us watch 7 seasons of television just to throw all the good content out the window and
                make the worst show possible. Everyone's character development suddenly disappeared, and they wrapped up
                all the conflicts for the past 7 seasons in 2 episodes. I now understand why high schools and colleges
                force students to take English classes.. it's so that people don't write scripts as bad as these ones.

            </div>
            <p>The original Ben 10 series was peak fiction, and this reboot exists solely to remind us that nothing good
                lasts. They massacred all of the character designs, and I can't imagine that this is any good. I don't
                even see how children could enjoy this more than the original series.</p>

            </div>
            <p>I'm just going to combine all of the Disney+ Marvel shows into one item, or else they would take up this
                entire list. Loki is the only good Marvel show that Disney+ has ever produced. Every other Marvel show
                is not good. It's sad because there is so much potential for these shows, and there are hundreds of
                millions of dollars being pumped into these shows, yet they still cannot create a good script. Disney+,
                please, just go on Reddit or something and steal some fanfiction, and turn it into a show. I promise it
                will be better than any Marvel show that currently exists.</p>

            <p>I watched like one episode of this as a joke, and I wish I could get that time back. I see random clips
                of it online, and how are they constantly killing off doctors in the most random ways possible?
                Suddenly, being a doctor at whatever hospital they work at is more dangerous than being in the military.
                Are they in Gotham City?</p>
