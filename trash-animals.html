            <p>This is such a pathetic design for an animal. They look so generic, and they do literally nothing other
                than exist. Not to mention, most other meats taste better than fish, so I really don't see what the
                point in them is.</p>

            <p>This animal is a wannabe villain. The only true big cat is the lion, and this version is just a poser.
                They are really basic, and they don't even do anything at the zoo. I admit that their patterns are cool,
                but they are still frauds. </p>

        <div class="card trash-card">

            </div>
            <p>This thing is unironically the worst animal of all time. It is estimated that over the course of human
                history, mosquitoes have killed over 52 billion people. This thing is literally evil incarnate. Also, it
                looks like a punk.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The cuckoo is known for laying its eggs in other birds' nests, and then letting the other bird parents
                take care of them. It is a literal parasite, and I don't even know how evolution got here. I heard the
                babies will sometimes kill the other babies so that they can get more food.</p>

            <p>This isn't some statement against climate change, I just don't like humans that much.</p>

            <div class="rating">
                <span class="star">★</span>
            </div>
            <p>Baby Yoda was very cool until the Internet found out about it. Then, it got ruined when everyone started
                creating nonstop merchandise about it. Also, a lot of the episodes really try and milk the cuteness for
                all that it's worth. Good things always get ruined.</p>

        <div class="card trash-card">

                <span class="star">★</span>
            </div>
            <p>Is this not just a seal? Why is it called a sea lion? I feel like that is disrespectful to actual lions.
                Also, they can be very aggressive and annoying. I just don't see the appeal.

        <div class="card trash-card">
            <img src="images/ben10.jpg" alt="Ben 10 image">

            <div class="rating">
                <span class="star">★</span>

            </div>
            <p>The original Ben 10 series was peak fiction, and this reboot exists solely to remind us that nothing good
                lasts. They massacred all of the character designs, and I can't imagine that this is any good. I don't
                even see how children could enjoy this more than the original series.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card trash-card">
            <img src="images/oompaloompa.jpg" alt="Oompa Loompa image">
            <p class="name">The Oompa Loompa</p>
            <div class="rating">
                <span class="star">★</span>

            </div>
            <p>I'm like 90% sure that this is not a human. I just don't enjoy the concept that there is an animal out
                there in the jungle that would willingly enslave itself for Willy Wonka just so they could get paid in
                chocolate. I'm very anti-slavery, so I don't get this concept. Also, did Willy Wonka essentially force
                them to abandon their cultural heritage and adopt a curly hairstyle like his? I just find it insulting
                that there is a creature out there that hates freedom and would enslave themselves for candy.</p>

        <div class="card trash-card">
            <img src="images/bee.jpg" alt="Bee image">
            <p class="name">The Bee</p>
            <div class="rating">
                <span class="star">★</span>

            </div>
            <p>First of all, didn't Barry B. Benson essentially steal some guy's wife? Not very cool if you ask me.
                Also, I think that bees in general are just annoying. They are always messing with bears when the bears
                try and get some honey. Everyone says that bees are essential for life on this planet, but I'm not
                buying it. Sounds like bee propaganda to me. Call me skeptical, but I don't believe in pollination.</p>
