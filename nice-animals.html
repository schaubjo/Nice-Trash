            <p>I'm surprised that this is a real animal. Nonetheless, it is at the pinnacle of evolution. The only
                reason it is not 5 stars is because I have yet to see one in real life to confirm its existence. This
                looks like the perfect animal if domesticated. It is one of the rare, non-demonic animals to come out of
                Australia.</p>

            <p>This is the true king of beasts. I've seen a video of one devouring a full-on gazelle, and it was
                awesome. This thing could breathe fire, and I would not be surprised. The tongue is menacing as well.
                They can also run very fast.</p>

            <p>Obviously, the dog comes in at 5 stars. It is the pinnacle of domesticated animals. It has no flaws. This
                is a photo of Barack Obama's dog.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The cat can either be a great or terrible pet. Some are very sociable while others are lame. They also
                defy physics at times which is pretty neat. I have heard that outdoor cats form gangs that spread across
                different cities. They also have a surprisingly long life-span.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <img src="images/rat.jpg" alt="Rat image">

                <span class="star">★</span>
                <span class="star">★</span>

                <span class="star">★</span>
            </div>
            <p>Expert survivalist, the rat has served as an example for what all species should strive to achieve:
                survival by any means necessary. I've never met anyone that grinds harder than the rat. The rat is
                persistent does what it needs to in order to accomplish its goals. It is a good metaphor for life.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <img src="images/stegosaurus.jpg" alt="Stegosaurus image">
            <p class="name">Stegosaurus</p>
            <div class="rating">

                <span class="star">★</span>

                <span class="star">★</span>
            </div>
            <p>I have to give credit where credit is due. The stegosaurus remains as part of the starting lineup in the
                animal kingdom. It has literal armor, and it could probably use its scales to absorb sunlight and charge
                its phone and stuff. There is a reason why the stegosaurus has remained alive after all these centuries,
                and it is because it is one of the greats.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <img src="images/snake.jpg" alt="Snake image">
            <p class="name">The Snake</p>
            <div class="rating">
                <span class="star">★</span>
                <span class="star">★</span>
                <span class="star">★</span>

                <span class="star">★</span>
            </div>
            <p>The snake is the original villain of the animal kingdom and The Bible I think. However, it is definitely
                one of the best written villains in literature. If I died by getting eaten by a snake, it would have
                been a good death.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <img src="images/centaur.jpg" alt="Centaur image">

                <span class="star">★</span>

                <span class="star">★</span>
            </div>
            <p>This is technically only half animal, but it definitely deserves to be on the list. They guard the
                forests at night, and they protect the United States from international terrorism threats. I don't like
                most horses though.</p>

            <p>Genuinely, one of the most innovative creations of all time. They are one of the most sophisticated
                beasts of the land, and they deserve our respect for the work that they do. They also have a fascinating
                fur pattern, and are much larger than most people think. They look wise. They remind me of Oogway for
                some reason.</p>

            </div>
            <p>This thing is a literal tank. It can survive in the cold, and it can definitely take down any polar bears
                that try and mess with it. It looks unreal.</p>
