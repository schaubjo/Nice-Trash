            <p>I genuinely cannot play this game, but I imagine it is very fun and satisfying to play if you are good.
                If I had a pool table, I would dedicate time to becoming really good at it, and then I would keep my
                talent hidden to the world. Only when someone challenges me for an extremely large sum of money would I
                reveal my pool skills.</p>

            <p>This looks super cool. I feel like harvesting your own honey would be super satisfying. Once I retire, I
                hope to venture into beekeeping.</p>

        <div class="card">

            </div>
            <p>Possibly one of the most strategic games ever invented, Uno brings thrill and fear to all who play. This
                is the only valid card game, and it really shows you who are your friends and who are snakes.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Nerf battles are testosterone incarnate. I don't know why these aren't still mainstream entertainment. I
                think if video games didn't exist, then Nerf would have monopolized the entertainment industry by now.
                Although, you do need to buy lots of Nerf guns which can be expensive, and cleaning up can be a pain.
                Also, if you play this as an adult, then you should probably reevaluate your life.</p>

            </div>
            <p>This has to be the coolest thing ever. You are literally digging up and polishing bones of gigantic,
                fire-breathing lizards that existed millions of years ago. The only issue is that I bet discovering them
                takes a while. However, the payoff in terms of satisfaction is probably huge. This is basically a more
                entertaining version of fishing.</p>

            <p>This is the musical instrument to end all musical instruments. You are creating music just by moving your
                hands through the air. I feel like if you dedicated your life to this, you could really do something
                incomprehensible. I don't know how this works, and I don't want to google it because I would rather keep
                it as a mystery.</p>

            <p>This just looks exhilarating. It looks super difficult too, so I feel like mastering it would be super
                satisfying. There is definitely a thrill of manipulating the molten glass using flames. You're basically
                firebending (note: Avatar is mid)</p>

            <p>This is the greatest work of literature ever created. Nothing in my life comes remotely close to the
                thrill of reading the newest chapter each week. There is nothing better than reading about a stretchy
                pirate boy that travels the world looking for treasure.</p>

            <p>Similar to beekeeping, this looks extremely satisfying. This is some next-level mysticism that needs to
                be explored. I don't know why they don't teach about this stuff in AP Bio.</p>
