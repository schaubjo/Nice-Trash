            <p>I thought I would hate this show because I hate British people and soccer, but I was pleasantly
                surprised. This show has a lot of good comedy and side characters. The 3rd season lacks some pzazz which
                is why it isn't 5 stars, but it is still very good.</p>

            <p>This show has a ton of mystery behind it and the payoff for some of the mysteries is super good. I enjoy
                Adam Scott in every role he is in, and he did a super good job here too. It is a crazy thriller that
                makes Stranger Things look terrible because it is.</p>

            <p>This show might go down as the greatest comedy show of all time. It has some of the best clips/lines of
                any show. The only issue is that there are so many episodes, and although some episodes are top tier,
                there are a lot of mediocre episodes in the newer seasons.</p>

            <p>The manga that this animated show is based on is easily the greatest piece of literature in existence,
                and the show is pretty good as well. It has really good animation, but it has the worst pacing of any
                show in the world. I still recommend it because most people are too lazy to read the manga.</p>

            <p>This show is easily one of the best cartoons, and it has a ton of notable actors. There is super good
                comedy and dialogue, and Will Arnett and Aaron Paul make an extremely good duo as a millionaire horse
                actor and a random homeless human.</p>

            <p>Obviously, season 8 is the worst written season in all of television, but the rest of the seasons deserve
                credit. Extremely good acting from actors I had never heard of, and it has some of the best
                world-building plot of any show other than One Piece. The music is also very good. I think the directors
                need to be blacklisted from making television after they made season 8 though.</p>

            <p>This show has zero flaws. It is not my favorite show of all time, but it genuinely has zero flaws other
                than Skyler White. I also am extremely impressed by the concept of the show in general. It has great
                cinematography and actors as well. I'm glad it put Aaron Paul on the map because he has become one of
                the best actors of all time in my opinion.</p>

            <p>This cartoon is exactly what a cartoon should be, just a bunch of short, whacky episodes with funny
                dialogue and a good overarching plot. There are a ton of unique characters from a stretchy dog to a
                princess made of bubblegum, and it has serious undertones and amazing lore.</p>

            <p>I don't even remember most of the episodes, but I remember it having super good dialogue. This show
                changed my opinion about British people. Great dialogue and great British people.</p>
