            </div>
            <p>Cardio has to be the most boring activity in existence. Most people that do it for health end up eating
                like trash anyway, so they essentially do it all for nothing. It is just the most brainrotting activity
                that I can think of. I think I can applaud someone for doing sprints, but I literally could not imagine
                having the patience to do long distance running. It would be a better use of my time to work at a
                Wendy's.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Every person I have ever seen that advertises cryptocurrency online looks like they weight 40 pounds
                soaking wet. Most of them don't even make money off of crypto, they just make money selling "business"
                courses to dumb teenagers. </p>

            </div>
            <p>These look dumb, and I've never seen a video of a successful gender reveal party. It always ends up with
                someone getting horribly killed or maimed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card trash-card">
            <img src="images/band.jpg" alt="Band image">

            <div class="rating">
                <span class="star">★</span>
            </div>
            <p>This is the epitome of low. Even former band kids talk trash about how bad band was in high school. I
                won't even say anything about this because I would have to type like a full essay describing why I think
                band is dumb.</p>

            </div>
            <p>I have never played or watched a single second of field hockey, but this sport looks unbelievably mid. It
                essentially is a watered-down version of regular hockey. This looks less entertaining than lacrosse.</p>

        <div class="card trash-card">

            <div class="rating">
                <span class="star">★</span>
            </div>
            <p>This sport is even worse than field hockey, and I've actually played this one. The only thing more boring
                than watching baseball is playing it. Everything is incredibly slow, and I don't know how this game
                became popular in the first place. Anytime I hear news about it online, it ends up just being a clip
                about Angel Hernandez being a bad umpire.</p>

            <p>I just don't really see the appeal. It's probably not the worst hobby, but it definitely isn't that cool.
                Also, nowadays, if you are just a casual photographer, it really just depends on how good your camera is
                in order to get a good photo. I'm sure some photography nerds might disagree, but I can definitely get
                extremely good photos with my IPhone 13 Pro Max without even trying. Also, a lot of these casual
                photographers try and charge people like $300 for a photo shoot. I would rather just take a few photos
                myself, and then get AI to edit them.

            </div>
            <p>This was cool in like 2016, but you'd have to be a complete loser to play Pokemon Go today. I know this
                because I still play Pokemon Go, and I am a complete loser.</p>

            </div>
            <p>This looks even more boring than going to a baseball game. This looks like it could be entertaining for 5
                seconds, and then you realize it sucks. This does not look fun.</p>
